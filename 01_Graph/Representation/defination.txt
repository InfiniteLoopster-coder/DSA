Graph Representation
|___Adjacency Matrix
|___Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix :- 
A 2D list(Matrix) where the cell at row i and column j indicate the presence (and optionally the weight)
of an edge between vertices i and j .This represent is useful for dence graph.

Adjacency List :- 
A dictionary (or list) where each key (or index) represent a vertex and maps to a list of its neightbor vertices.
This is more memory efficent for sparse graph.
